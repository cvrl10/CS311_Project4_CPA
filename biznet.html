				<h1>Biography</h1>

				Georges Bizet (1838-1875)<br />
				=========================<br />

				<p>The composer of the classic opera "Carmen" was born in 1838 near Paris.<br />
				Bizet's first teacher was his father, a noted voice teacher and pianist.<br />
				Later he studied at the Paris Conservatory, where one of his instructors<br />
				was Gounod. At 19, Bizet won the prestigious Prix de Rome.<br /></p>

				<p>Bizet's first opera, "La Maison du Docteur," was written when he was only<br />
				14. He wrote "Le Docteur Miracle" in 1857, winning the Prix de Rome. This<br />
				piece was later performed at the Bouffes-Parisiens. Bizet used the prize<br />
				money from the award to subsidize his stay in Paris. From 1858 to 1860,<br />
				Bizet started several operas, but managed to only finish one, "Don<br /> 
				Procopio." This opera, written in 1859, was not put on stage until 1906.<br />
				Lacking commercial success, Bizet made his living from teaching the<br /> 
				piano, and as a accompanist for other people's work.<br /></p>

				<p>Yet, he still wrote. The 1863 opera, "Les Pêcheurs de Perles," takes place<br />
				in the Orient, and probably contains material from his earlier, unfinished<br />
				operas. The opera did not meet with either commercial or critical success.<br /> 
				Hector Berlioz, who praised the opera, was one notable exception.<br />
				Nevertheless, Bizet received a commission for another work, the<br /> 
				five-act "Ivan IV" in 1865. Sadly, production on this opera had to be<br />
				abandoned after many delays and problems. "Ivan IV" had to wait until 1946<br />
				before being received on stage.<br /></p>

				<p>Other operas followed, by none of them were commercial or critical<br />
				successes. The production of "La Jolie Fille de Perth" was met with<br />
				better reviews, but not commercial acclaim. The same was true of "Djamileh,"<br />
				written in 1871.<br /></p>

				<p>Despite his failures, Bizet was asked to write an opera based on<br />
				Merimee's "Carmen." Controversy surrounded the piece because of its subject<br />
				matter. Bizet refused to water-down the material, despite the fear that<br />
				the opera would alienate the public. The public was alienated. The opera<br />
				closed after only 48 performances. Yet, a year after Bizet's death, the<br />
				piece was revived with a series of triumphant performances in Vienna.<br />
				"Carmen" is recognized as Bizet's masterpiece, and a classic.<br /></p>

				<p>Bizet died in 1875 at the age of 42.<br /></p>
