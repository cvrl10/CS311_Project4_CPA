            Ran into some problem while tryning to align the menu strip, initially I tried formatting in the container but it wasn't 
            aligning the way I wanted it to, defining the format in the class had it working the way I expected it to.

            One outsanding problem is that I wanted to move my signature for the home page towards the bottom of the page,
            as opposed to having it directly below the picture.

            I also tried to use one of Bootstrap's implemented grid layout but the margin was too big leaving a huge margin at 
            the edge of the page, so I ended up defining my own.
