				<h1>Biography</h1>

                Giuseppe Verdi (1813-1901)<br />
                ==========================<br />
                
                <p>Giuseppe Verdi was born in Roncole on October 10th, 1813, the son of a<br /> 
                tavern keeper. Verdi learned music starting at the age of<br />
                three from a pastor in his village's church using a spinette that Verdi<br />
                owned. The spinette still survives in a museum in Milan.<br /></p>
                
                <p>Verdi's genius was evident from the beginning. He composed instrumental<br /> 
                religious works, sinfonies, and arias for the Filarmonica di Busseto -<br />
                the philharmonic band located near the village where Verdi grew up.<br /></p>
                
                <p>From very early on, Verdi wanted to be an opera composer. At the beginning<br /> 
                it was difficult to find a good libretto, and it was almost impossible to<br /> 
                find a stage to perform the completed work. No theater trusted<br />
                the work of a novice composer. Through hard work and diligence, Verdi<br /> 
                eventually experienced modest success with his opera "Oberto" in 1839.<br />
                A few years later in 1842, he had even greater success with "Nabucco."<br /> 
                The opera, interpreted as a political statement on the oppression of the<br /> 
                Hebrews, was met with international acclaim.<br /></p>
                
                <p>Even with his first operas, Verdi displayed a captivating new style.<br /> 
                His style was bold and subtle in a way that was different from the<br /> 
                masters of the period like Rossini, Donizzeti and Bellini. Verdi was a<br />
                prolific composer. Within a ten-year period he wrote several operas<br /> 
                including "Ernani" in 1844 and "MacBeth" in  1847. These operas showcased<br /> 
                Verdi's ability to combine character and story alongside his compelling<br /> 
                music.<br /></p>
                
                <p>Verdi's success continued into the early 1850's with "Rigoletto" in<br /> 
                1851, "Il Trovatore" in 1853, and, of course, "La Traviata", also in<br /> 
                1853. Verdi had reached the point where he could refuse commissions,<br /> 
                instead concentrating only on those tasks that interested him. The<br /> 
                operas "Don Carlos" in 1867, and "Aida" in 1871, deftly explored the<br /> 
                conflicts between public and private responsibility.<br /></p>
                
                <p>After retiring to become a gentleman farmer in Sant'Agata near his<br /> 
                birthplace, Verdi was persuaded to return to composing with the<br /> 
                opportunity to create an opera based on Shakespeare's "Othello."<br /> 
                The result, "Otello" in 1887, is a masterpiece of dramatic pacing and<br /> 
                musical structure. Other operas followed, including the opera "Falstaff,"<br /> 
                based on Shakespeare's play, "The Merry Wives of Windsor."<br /></p>
                
                <p>Verdi died on January 27, 1901 at the age of 88.<br /></p>
