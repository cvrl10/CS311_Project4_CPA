                Richard Wagner (1813 - 1883)<br />
                ============================<br />
                
                <p>Richard Wagner was born in Venice on May 22, 1813. As a youth, he<br />
                studied music in Leipzig. His first opera, "Die Feen" was written at the<br />
                age of 20, in 1833. This was followed in 1836 with the unsuccessful<br />
                "Das Liebesverbot". That same year, Wagner married the actress Minna<br />
                Planer. Wagner and his family lived for a few years in Königsberg, and<br />
                then later, in Riga. While in Paris from 1839 to 1842, he composed the<br />
                grand opera, "Rienzi," and the tragedy, "Der Fliegende Holländer."<br /></p>
                
                <p>The success of "Rienzi" led to Wagner's appointment as music director in<br />
                Dresden. More successes followed with "Tannhäuser" in 1845 and "Lohengrin"<br />
                in 1850. However, at the same time, Wagner became involved with political<br />
                radicals. He was forced to Switzerland after his participation in the<br />
                1849 Dresden uprisings.<br /></p>
                
                <p>In exile, Wagner began work on his four opera cycle, "Der Ring des<br />
                Nibelungen," which occupied much of his life. Taking time off from his<br /> 
                work on the "Ring", Wagner composed the romantic tragedy, "Tristan und<br />
                Isolde." The opera, "Die Meistersinger" followed a few years later. This<br />
                opera is notorious for the anti-Semitic expressions of the protagonist.<br /></p>
                
                <p>In 1860, he was allowed to return to Germany. A triumphant performance of<br /> 
                "Tannhäuser" in Paris confirmed Wagner's stature as international artist of<br />
                great renown.<br /></p>
                
                <p>Finally in 1876, the "Ring" premiered in Bayreuth. The strain of raising<br />
                money and getting the production ready greatly affected Wagner's health.<br />
                His final opera, "Parsifal," was presented at the second Bayreuth festival<br />
                in 1882.<br /></p>
                
                <p>Wagner died on February 13th, 1883 at the age of 69.<br /></p>
