                Giacomo Puccini (1858 - 1924)<br />
                ============================<br />
                
                <p>Giacomo Puccini was born on December 22, 1858, to a family of church<br />
                musicians in Lucca. He first studied with his uncle at the Instituto<br />
                Pacini in Lucca, but a performance of Verdi's "Aida" brought forth a love<br />
                for operatic composition. Puccini attended the Milan Conservatory and<br />
                studied under Bazzini and Ponchielli. His first opera, "Le Villi," was<br />
                written in 1884, at the age of 26.<br /></p>
                
                <p>The opera "Edgar," written in 1893, was a failure, but "Manon Lescaut"<br />
                proved to be an international success. More successes followed, including<br />
                three of the most popular operas in history: "La Bohème" (1896),<br />
                "Tosca" (1900), and the incomparable "Madama Butterfly," written in 1904.<br />
                For each opera, Puccini collaborated with the librettists Illica and<br />
                Giacosa. The successful team broke up with Giacosa's death in 1906.<br /></p>
                
                <p>Domestic tragedies plagued the rest of Puccini's life. His next opera,<br />
                "The West," did not appear until 1910. Although containing many musical<br />
                and stylistic innovations, this opera has never received the popular<br />
                acclaim of his earlier work.<br /></p>
                
                <p>Puccini's final opera, "Turandot," produced in 1926, is a grand and<br />
                ambitious piece. Sadly, the work was unfinished and the final act had<br /> 
                to be written by Franco Alfano. The conductor, Leopold Stokowski, later<br />
                refused to conduct the final act; instead, he told the audience, "and<br />
                here the composer laid down his pen." Stokowski then left the stage.<br /></p>
                
                <p>Puccini died on November 29, 1924 in Brussels at the age of 65.<br /></p>
